# This a **very** simple anti bot protection. Recommendation is to use a a dedicated program to approach this
# problem. Low level firewalls like uwf (or iptables direct) are more efficient than a Minecraft plugin. TCP reverse
# proxies could also be used and offload some work even to different host.
#
# The settings wil limit how many connections this plugin will handle. After hitting this limit. FastLogin will
# completely ignore incoming connections. Effectively there will be no database requests and network requests.
# Therefore auto logins won't be possible.
anti-bot:
  # Image the following like bucket. The following is total amount that is allowed in this bucket, while expire
  # means how long it takes for every entry to expire.
  # Total number of connections
  connections: 600
  # Amount of minutes after the first connection got inserted will expire and made available
  expire: 10

# Request a premium login without forcing the player to type a command
#
# If you activate autoRegister, this plugin will check/do these points on login:
# 1. An existing cracked account shouldn't exist
# -> paid accounts cannot steal the existing account of cracked players
# - (Already registered players could still use the /premium command to activate premium checks)
# 2. Automatically registers an account with a strong random generated password
# -> cracked player cannot register an account for the premium player and so cannot the steal the account
#
# Furthermore the premium player check have to be made based on the player name
# This means if a cracked player connects to the server and we request a paid account login from this player
# the player just disconnect and sees the message: 'bad login' or 'invalid session'
# There is no way to change this message
# For more information: https://github.com/games647/FastLogin#why-do-players-have-to-invoke-a-command
autoRegister: false

# Should FastLogin respect per IP limit of registrations (e.g. in AuthMe)
# Because most auth plugins do their stuff async - FastLogin will still think the player was registered
# To work best - you also need to enable auto-register-unknown
#
# If set to true - FastLogin will always attempt to register the player, even if the limit is exceeded
# It is up to the auth plugin to handle the excessive registration
# https://github.com/games647/FastLogin/issues/458
respectIpLimit: false

# This is extra configuration option to the feature above. If we request a premium authentication from a player who
# isn't actual premium but used a premium username, the player will disconnect with the reason "invalid session" or
# "bad login".
#
# If you activate this, we are remembering this player and do not force another premium authentication if the player
# tries to join again, so the player could join as cracked player.
secondAttemptCracked: false

# New cracked players will be kicked from server. Good if you want switch from offline-mode to online-mode without
# losing players!
#
# Existing cracked and premium players could still join your server. Moreover you could add playernames to a
# allowlist.
# So that these cracked players could join too although they are new players.
switchMode: false

# If this plugin detected that a player has a premium, it can also set the associated
# uuid from that account. So if the player changes the username, they will still have
# the same player data (inventory, permissions, ...)
#
# Warning: This also means that the UUID will be different if the player is connecting
# through a offline mode connection. This **could** cause plugin compatibility issues.
#
# This is a example and doesn't apply for every plugin.
# Example: If you want to ban players who aren't online at the moment, the ban plugin will look
# after a offline uuid associated to the player, because the server is in offline mode. Then the premium
# players could still join the server, because they have different UUID.
#
# Moreover you may want to convert the offline UUID to a premium UUID. This will ensure that the player
# will have the same inventory, permissions, ... if they switched to premium authentication from offline/cracked
# authentication.
#
# This feature requires Cauldron, Spigot or a fork of Spigot (Paper)
premiumUuid: false

# This will make an additional check (only for player names which are not in the database) against the mojang servers
# in order to get the premium UUID. If that premium UUID is in the database, we can assume on successful login that the
# player changed it's  username and we just update the name in the database.
# Examples:
# #### Case 1
# autoRegister = false
# nameChangeCheck = false
#
# GameProfile logins as cracked until the player invoked the command /premium. Then we could override the existing
# database record.
#
# #### Case 2
# autoRegister = false
# nameChangeCheck = true
#
# Connect the Mojang API and check what UUID the player has (UUID exists => Paid Minecraft account). If that UUID is in
# the database it's an **existing player** and FastLogin can **assume** the player is premium and changed the username.
# If it's not in the database, it's a new player and **could be a cracked player**. So we just use a offline mode
# authentication for this player.
#
# **Limitation**: Cracked players who uses the new username of a paid account cannot join the server if the database
# contains the old name. (Example: The owner of the paid account no longer plays on the server, but changed the username
# in the meanwhile).
#
# #### Case 3
# autoRegister = true
# nameChangeCheck = false
#
# We will always request a premium authentication if the username is unknown to us, but is in use by a paid Minecraft
# account. This means it's kind of a more aggressive check like nameChangeCheck = true and autoRegister = false, because
# it request a premium authentication which are completely new to us, that even the premium UUID is not in our database.
#
# **Limitation**: see below
#
# #### Case 4
# autoRegister = true
# nameChangeCheck = true
#
# Based on autoRegister it checks if the player name is premium and login using a premium authentication. After that
# fastlogin receives the premium UUID and can update the database record.
#
# **Limitation from autoRegister**: New offline players who uses the username of an existing Minecraft cannot join the
# server.
nameChangeCheck: false

# If your players have a premium account and a skin associated to their account, this plugin
# can download the data and set it to the online player.
#
# Keep in mind that this will only works if the player:
# * is the owner of the premium account
# * the server connection is established through a premium connection (paid account authentication)
# * has a skin
#
# This means this plugin doesn't need to create a new connection to the Mojang servers, because
# the skin data is included in the Auth-Verification-Response sent by Mojang. If you want to use for other
# players like cracked player, you have to use other plugins.
#
# If you use PaperSpigot - FastLogin will always try to set the skin, even if forwardSkin is set to false
# It is needed to allow premium name change to work correctly
# https://github.com/games647/FastLogin/issues/457
#
# If you want to use skins for your cracked player, you need an additional plugin like
# ChangeSkin, SkinRestorer, ...
forwardSkin: true

# Displays a warning message that this message SHOULD only be invoked by
# users who actually are the owner of this account. So not by cracked players
#
# If they still want to invoke the command, they have to invoke /premium again
premium-warning: true

# If you have autoRegister or nameChangeCheck enabled, you could be rate-limited by Mojang.
# The requests of the both options will be only made by FastLogin if the username is unknown to the server
# You are allowed to make 600 requests per 10-minutes (60 per minute)
# If you own a big server this value could be too low
# Once the limit is reached, new players are always logged in as cracked until the rate-limit is expired.
# (to the next ten minutes)
#
# The limit is IP-wide. If you have multiple IPv4-addresses you specify them here. FastLogin will then use it in
# rotating order --> 5 different IP-addresses 5 * 600 per 10 minutes
# If this list is empty only the default one will be used
#
# Lists are created like this:
#ip-addresses:
#    - 192-168-0-2
ip-addresses: [ ]

# How many requests should be established to the Mojang API for Name -> UUID requests. Some other plugins as well
# as the head Minecraft block make such requests as well. Using this option you can limit the amount requests this
# plugin should make.
#
# If you lower this value, other plugins could still make requests while FastLogin cannot.
# Mojang limits the amount of request to 600 per 10 minutes per IPv4-address.
mojang-request-limit: 600

# This option automatically registers players which are in the FastLogin database, but not in the auth plugin database.
# This can happen if you switch your auth plugin or cleared the database of the auth plugin.
# https://github.com/games647/FastLogin/issues/85
auto-register-unknown: false

# This disables the auto login from fastlogin. So a premium (like a paid account) authentication is requested, but
# the player won't be auto logged into the account.
#
# This can be used as 2Factor authentication for better security of your accounts. A hacker then needs both passwords.
# The password of your Minecraft and the password to login in with your auth plugin
autoLogin: true

# Floodgate configuration
# Connecing through Floodgate requires player's to sign in via their Xbox Live account
# !!!!!!!! WARNING: FLOODGATE SUPPORT IS AN EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE !!!!!!!!
# Enabling any of these settings might lead to people gaining unauthorized access to other's accounts!

# Automatically log in players connecting through Floodgate.
# Possible values:
#   false: Disables auto login for every player connecting through Floodgate
#   true: Enables auto login for every player connecting through Floodgate
#   linked: Only Bedrock accounts that are linked to a Java account will be logged in automatically
#   no-conflict: Bedrock players will only be automatically logged in if the Mojang API reports
#     that there is no existing Premium Java MC account with their name.
#     This option can be useful if you are not using 'username-prefix' in floodgate/config.yml
# Requires 'autoLogin' to be 'true'
# !!!!!!!! WARNING: FLOODGATE SUPPORT IS AN EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE !!!!!!!!
# Enabling this might lead to people gaining unauthorized access to other's accounts!
autoLoginFloodgate: false

# This enables Floodgate players to join the server, even if autoRegister is true and there's an existing
# Java **PREMIUM** account with the same name
#
# Java and Bedrock players will get different UUIDs, so their inventories, location, etc. will be different.
# However, some plugins (such as AuthMe) rely on names instead of UUIDs to identify a player which might cause issues.
# In the case of AuthMe (and other auth plugins), both the Java and the Bedrock player will have the same password.
#
# To prevent conflits from two different players having the same name, it is highly recommended to use a 'username-prefix'
# in floodgate/config.yml
# Note: 'username-prefix' is currently broken when used with FastLogin and ProtocolLib. For more information visit:
#   https://github.com/games647/FastLogin/issues/493
# A solution to this is to replace ProtocolLib with ProtocolSupport
#
# Possible values:
#   false: Check for Premium Java name conflicts as described in 'autoRegister'
#     Note: Linked players have the same name as their Java profile, so the Bedrock player will always conflict
#     their own Java account's name. Therefore, setting this to false will prevent any linked player from joining.
#   true:  Bypass 'autoRegister's name conflict checking
#   linked: Bedrock accounts linked to a Java account will be allowed to join with conflicting names
# !!!!!!!! WARNING: FLOODGATE SUPPORT IS AN EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE !!!!!!!!
# Enabling this might lead to people gaining unauthorized access to other's accounts!

# Database configuration
# Recommended is the use of MariaDB (a better version of MySQL)

# Single file SQLite database
driver: 'org.sqlite.JDBC'
# File location
database: '{pluginDir}/FastLogin.db'

# MySQL/MariaDB
# If you want to enable it uncomment only the lines below this not this line.
# If on velocity use 'fastlogin.mariadb.jdbc.Driver' as driver
#driver: 'com.mysql.jdbc.Driver'
#host: '127.0.0.1'
#port: 3306
#database: 'fastlogin'
#username: 'myUser'
#password: 'myPassword'

# Advanced Connection Pool settings in seconds
#timeout: 30
#lifetime: 30

## It's recommended to enable SSL if the MySQL server isn't running on the same host
## This will encrypt the connection for secure transportation of the sql server password
#useSSL: false
## Verification requirements for the server cert,
## Values: Required (unchecked SSL connection), VerifyCA (verify CA), VerifyFull (verify CA and matching hostname)
#sslMode=Required
## TLS is preferred for this technique, then your host stored certificate store will be used to verify the server cert
## Similar to HTTPS. If that's not possible RSA can be used with the following options.
## This allows to request the public RSA key from the server to encrypt the data to it. True would allow machine-in-the-
## middle attacks.
#allowPublicKeyRetrieval=false
## Path to the RSA public key if key retrieval is forbidden
#ServerRSAPublicKeyFile=

# HTTP proxies for connecting to the Mojang servers in order to check if the username of a player is premium.
# This is a workaround to prevent rate-limiting by Mojang. These proxies will only be used once your server hit
# the rate-limit or the custom value above.
# Please make sure you use reliable proxies.
proxies:
# 'IP:Port' or 'Domain:Port'
# - 'xyz.com:1337'
# - 'test.com:5131'
